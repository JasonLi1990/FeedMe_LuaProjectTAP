It's that time of the year when winter sports enthusiasts dust off their skis and snowboards and get ready to hit the slopes in search of perfect powder and fresh adventures.
The choice of ski resort is key to that enjoyment and a good place to start might be Solden in Austria where the Alpine Skiing World Cup starts next weekend on the treacherous Rettenbach Glacier.

The courses set for the daredevil professionals might prove a little daunting for the average skier -- but help is at hand from Olympic legends who forged their reputation at that highest level, yet still appreciate the needs of the less gifted participant.

Step forward Tommy Moe, whose approach may border on the reckless but who seized his moment to win the blue riband event in alpine skiing. Moe's gold in the downhill at the Lillehammer Games of 1994 came as a surprise to almost everyone but himself. He sensed something special would happen. "I thought today's the day, I will either win or crash," he told CNN. Making the World Cup trophy Ski champs come full circle "You have to have that sort of mentality. Looking back I was at the peak of my career." He went on to win silver in the super-G to complete a triumphant Games. His fellow American Chris Klug is another ski aficionado.

Klug was given a precious second chance of life after a liver transplant and grabbed it with both hands to join Moe in Winter Olympic folklore. Klug spent nearly a decade on a transplant waiting list after being diagnosed with a rare condition, but it did not stop him competing in the parallel giant slalom event at the 1998 Nagano Winter Games. Two years later he underwent successful surgery after a perfect donor match was found and within weeks was training again for his demanding sport. "I was so glad that my lifestyle had not been compromised," he told CNN.
